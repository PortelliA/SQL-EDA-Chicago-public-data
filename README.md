# Chicago Data Analysis with SQL

## Project Summary
This project is a small demonstration of SQL in action, using datasets provided by the City of Chicagoâ€™s Data Portal. The goal was to analyze data and solve assignment problems using three key datasets:

1. **Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago**:
   - Contains six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a "hardship index" for each Chicago community area from 2008-2012.
   - [Dataset link](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2)

2. **Chicago Public Schools**:
   - Shows school-level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year.

3. **Chicago Crime Data**:
   - Reflects reported incidents of crime in Chicago from 2001 to present.
   - Due to the large size of the crime dataset, a smaller subset was used.

## Key SQL Techniques and Tasks
- **Filtering data** to find specific records, such as crimes involving an arrest or community areas starting with a specific letter.
- **Using aggregates** to calculate totals and averages, such as the total number of crimes or the average school safety score.
- **Distinct queries** to identify unique values, like types of crimes at specific locations.
- **Joining tables** to combine data from different sources, for example, linking crime data with school data.
- **Subqueries** to find detailed information, like the community area with the least school safety score.
- **Creating views** to simplify complex queries and hide sensitive information, such as school ratings.
